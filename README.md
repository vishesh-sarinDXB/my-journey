# Introduction

Hi everyone!

I recently wrote a post about the journey I will be undertaking over the coming year to focus on improving my technical skills. Someone pointed out that how I had written it kind of undermined the request I was making of the community so I wanted to rewrite it a bit focussing on the core aspects of it.

Fundamentally, I am not where I want to be when it comes to my technical skills, and I am dedicating the coming year to building the processes necessary to improve. I will outline what I am going to do specifically below and I hope to receive feedback on how I could be doing even better (both here on this post, and also on my notebooks / datasets that I hopefully will be uploading over the coming year). This would be deeply appreciated and in general would hope that the community helps me stay accountable to this.

# The 4X Path

I recently underwent a health transformation, and I hope to take some teachings from there and apply it here. I found a combination of James Clear’s Atomic Habits, Andrew Huberman’s Morning Routine, and Social Accountability was helped me become consistent about doing the right things for my body. Furthermore, when it comes to knowledge work, in my past I found having a goal helped me really get things in gear too along with taking a hybrid top-down and bottom-up approach.

So in specifics I am committing to doing a little bit every day. At least 10 mins of effort to one of the things listed below. To track them I will update on this post (I have a GitHub for this post / pseudo blog that I will focus on keeping most updated as I will use it for tracking, but I will attempt to keep parity with this Kaggle Forum post as well). I will also attempt to do this as early in the day as possible so that I am fresh when I get to it (I do have a day job that may take precedence at times, but I will still do my best here). Finally, I hope to have 10 very high quality (3 gold medals each) notebooks on Kaggle by the time this year has ended (20th June 2025), and 1 end-to-end side project.

Any item from the following list that I will accomplish (with a minimum of 10 mins of effort, though initially 10 mins alone will be my goal), I will consider as completing my goal for the day. When completed I will update the Github (and try to do so the Kaggle forum post as well, but GitHub is my priority because I will use it for tracking this). 

- Responding to or writing one discussion post in the Kaggle forums (competition or otherwise)
- Attempting to read a research paper
- Attempting to summarize a research paper
- Attempting to recreate a paper with code
- Joining a Competition
- Attempting to summarize notebooks for an active or completed competition
- Attempting to improve upon a notebook for an active or completed competition
- Attempting to create an original notebook
- Going through a FastAI lesson
- Recreating a Notebook From a FastAI lesson
- Reading the FastAI book
- Reading other more technical books
- Khan Academy Math Lessons (Will start really low because my math skills have atrophied so will probably jump straight to quizzes for the lower levels)
- Khan Academy Quizzes
- Recreating Khan Academy Lessons as Notebooks
- Reading documentation for popular libraries / packages
- Creating notebooks regarding certain aspects from said documentation
- Creating notebooks exploring popular mathematical functions / algorithms / model architectures
- Anything that anyone else suggests to be added to this list

I will commit to the GitHub repo every day, and if I manage to finish off more than one line item, I will make a separate commit for each, also listing an approximation of how much time I spent on that. I will probably start with Khan Academy as it is definitely the low hanging fruit on this list.

I would love to hear everyone’s feedback on the plan and any feedback on how I could improve further would be much appreciated! Furthermore, I reiterate my request to help me stay accountable!

Thank you so much for reading and I hope to hear back from any all that read this post of mine!

# TL;DR

I am not where I want to be when it comes to my technical skills as a data scientist. I am going to use a hybrid bottom up and top down approach to do so. I will commit to doing at least 10 mins of work on this every day. I request the community to hold me accountable / give me feedback. I will keep the GitHub updated with my journey everyday.
