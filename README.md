# TL;DR

The following is really long (this kind of got away from me). So putting the TL;DR up first.

I suck at data science. I am declaring that I will be a 4X GrandMaster by 20th of June 2025. I am going to use a hybrid bottom up and top down approach to do so. I will commit to doing at least 10 mins of work on this every day. I want you to hold me accountable / give me tons of critical feedback (seriously no need for positive reinforcement). I will keep the GitHub updated with my journey everyday.

# Introduction

I wish to preface this by saying that I am not looking for positive reinforcement. Tell me I am crazy, tell me it’s impossible, tell me I am downright stupid. If possible tell me what I could be doing better. If you are going to comment on one of my commits (or the Kaggle forum post that I will hope to keep parity with), and say something like I am doing great or that I am already better than x percent of people or something like that, then please refrain.

# Who am I

My name is Vishesh Sarin. I was born 29th of May 1992 in Fujairah, UAE. My father was in the merchant navy till an accident caused him to lose his leg and seek work shoreside. My mother was a Hindi teacher until 2020 when she was diagnosed with a type of blood cancer and was forced to retire.

I was a naive young kid who wanted to do nothing more than help people (a naive part of me I still hold). I did well in school till my final few years. Prior to graduating I faltered significantly partially due to some familial issues, but primarily because of my own teenage stupidity. I blamed others for my failings at the time, and carried that attitude well into college.

# Where have I been

I was lucky enough to get into the University of California, Davis. Similarly I was stupid enough to change my major from Computer Science to Pharmaceutical Chemistry. I tell people that this was because I wanted to explore what was out there in the physical sciences and that the major gave me good exposure to a wide range of disciplines (and this was a small sliver of the truth), but honestly I was just doing poorly in my Computer Science classes and didn’t want to put the effort into overcoming the challenges I was facing. Overall the stupidity of this decision lied in the fact that data science was extremely interesting to me (especially in the context of the medical field). Furthermore, I didn’t even bother to gather enough credits to graduate with even a minor in Computer Science.

Though honestly getting those credits wouldn’t have even mattered. I screwed up my GPA so bad in the initial 3 years at Davis that even when I got my act together and gave it my all I was only barely able to graduate. Graduating with no honors and a crappy GPA meant the job market was tough. After several hard months of searching I found my first job at a very cash strapped research lab in UC Irvine.

I did some analysis there that I didn’t really understand as I actually just fed data to a proprietary software which did the analysis for me. Most of the time I was doing cell culture (a method of growing human cells in a dish to run experiments on) and other maintenance work (such as defrosting the freezers or sterilizing lab equipment). UC Irvine had some data science workshops for employees at the time that I frequented. Every time I went I was overwhelmed primarily because I had a hard time focussing and spent most of my time talking to others there rather than actually following along with the workshop. I also spent some time learning from online videos (though mostly high concept stuff from the likes of 3Blue1Brown and CGP Grey rather than deep understanding). While I had improved from the time I was in college, I know I was still wasting too much time doing stupid young people stuff. 

I looked for new work, and lucked into a job with a much more resource rich lab at UCSF. While I was primarily hired for my cell culture experience, my boss was really kind and helped setup a data centric project. He partnered with a bioinformatics lab (as he didn’t have the technical expertise to actually help me, other than with data acquisition and overall direction of what we actually wanted to ask and answer). This other lab allocated a graduate student to help me get the project off the ground. 

I was excited like I never was before. I was thinking “wow, finally a chance to actually learn this stuff by doing, and I have actual guidance too.” I threw myself into it like I had never done before with anything. I learned so much and grew my knowledge 10 fold in just a few months (though not as impressive in retrospect as I was starting nearly from zero). I started to believe in myself. 

That all came crashing down. I still believed in helping people, and that’s what drew me to data science as I saw the potential it held in the medical field, and so with my new found confidence I believed that I could get a PhD in Bioinformatics. I must have applied to about a dozen schools. Completely excited sending them all in with my boss’s recommendation attached thinking surely I’d get into at least one. I was wrong. It didn’t really hit till about the 7th or 8th rejection that this wasn’t happening. I realized that I was a “andho main kadha sardar” (man with one eye amongst the blind). I didn’t really know things, but actually just knew a bit more than the people around me. 

My visa was about to come to an end, and along with the fact that I wasn’t getting into any PhD programs I decided to go back home (though the decision was mostly made for me by my circumstances). I was hurt quite a bit, but my belief in myself didn’t just die out. I re-evaluated a few things. Primarily that I should apply for Masters programs and not PhD’s and secondly I should focus more on regular data science. The reasoning for the former is obvious, it is less competitive and a pathway to a PhD. The latter was more nuanced, in a way I was making things harder for myself as my background didn’t quite support it (though I did have my publication from UCSF), but on the other hand I had changed from looking at what I would have liked to what I really wanted. I wanted to help people, and I wanted to be in a vocation that kept me mentally engaged. I would have liked to do that by pursuing bioinformatics. So I paused and asked if that was the pathway that really was the most efficient to getting what I wanted (and it wasn’t). I wouldn’t be achieving financial sustainability in a reasonable timeframe, and I would be geo locked to certain regions around the world where work like this was available. With this new found understanding, I threw myself into my applications once more, and while I was still rejected from a majority of universities I managed to get into Heriot-Watt (Dubai Campus). 

The year I got in was the same year as a global pandemic and my mother being diagnosed with cancer. The pandemic was problematic on its own but my mom became bedridden during this time. I chose to became her primary caretaker. I don’t want to go into the gory details but you can imagine what it takes to ensure the health of an elderly person who is bound to the bed. I felt like I was going to be crushed, but unlike in my past I didn’t blame anyone else, and I didn’t shy away from what needed to be done. I pushed through on all fronts, and made sure I graduated with distinction (straight A’s), and I made sure that mom kept going on (God bless she is doing much better these days). I continued on and fought through for my first job in the UAE. I negotiated a decent package and all was good. 

I started to rest on my laurels again. The job was more data engineering / other ad hoc data work rather than any real data science, and I let my skills atrophy. Not that they were particularly great to begin with. Getting my Masters only shows how well I can do classes not how well I knew data science, something I constantly felt but not one I let on to others. I got lazy and fell into bad health habits (I was always a smoker, but I was also eating very poorly, starting to drink heavily, and not exercising at all). 

I caught myself last year and decided to change. The core issue was not capability to push myself when needed (my time at UCSF, becoming my mothers caretaker, and graduating from Heriot-Watt all proved that I can do that), but maintaining consistency when there was no call to action. 

# Where I want to go 

One of the first things that I decided to action on (because it had the easiest answers) was my health. I quit drinking completely, I downgraded from smoking cigarettes to vaping (not quite healthy but better than cigarettes), I tried improving my eating habits (this one I am still struggling with), and I started exercising. I was very inconsistent with all of this at the beginning.

Then quite a few things happened. I was exposed to both the Huberman morning routine, and James Clear’s atomic habits. Both of these improved my consistency quite a bit, but still not a hundred percent. Not till I hired a trainer. The combination of getting a good start to the day, making sure to do a little bit every day, and having some social accountability worked for me. 

The second was getting a new environment. I needed to get a new job. Here I struggled quite a bit. I tried optimizing my CV and LinkedIn, and I tried posting on LinkedIn for a while as well, but it didn’t seem like it was working. I wasn’t quite sure what to do but one magical day I managed to luck into my current gig. 

Here I am faced with the thing I have been avoiding for quite some time. Fundamentally, I am not that good as a data scientist. Unlike my previous job, I was not the only data scientist here and I can tell very obviously that I am in the bottom 20% in terms of technical capabilities. I can’t plot to save my life and I don’t have experience with anything more advanced than XGB. My only saving grace is that I can articulate myself well (though am overly wordy as you may have already noticed). 

To me this is awesome, it means I have room to grow. It means I can learn from my colleagues. Most importantly, it forces into the forefront something that I have been ignoring for too long. I suck at data science, and I want to begin a journey that makes it so that I will be among the best.

I declare right now, that one year from now I am going to be a 4X Kaggle Grandmaster. 

# How I’m going to get there

I personally believe in a hybrid approach. Specifically both a top down and a bottom up approach in terms of what I will be learning. I also want to take my lessons learned from my health journey. I am going to commit to doing a little bit everyday, I am going to try to do so right after my morning routine as it is without a doubt the best part of my day, and I am requesting anyone reading this to keep me accountable. Like I said at the top, tell me all the things I am screwing up on and how I could be doing things better. Nothing too small to point out, all critics welcome!

Regarding the atomicity of it all, anything that I can accomplish from the list below (with a minimum of 10 mins of effort, though initially 10 mins will be my goal), I will consider as completing my goal for the day. When completed I will update the GitHub (and try to do so the Kaggle forum post as well, but GitHub is my priority because I will use it for tracking this). 

- Responding to or writing one discussion post in the Kaggle forums (competition or otherwise)
- Attempting to read a research paper
- Attempting to summarize a research paper
- Attempting to recreate a paper with code
- Joining a Competition
- Attempting to summarize notebooks for an active or completed competition
- Attempting to improve upon a notebook for an active or completed competition
- Attempting to create an original notebook
- Going through a FastAI lesson
- Recreating a Notebook From a FastAI lesson
- Reading the FastAI book
- Reading other more technical books
- Khan Academy Math Lessons (my math skills have atrophied)
- Khan Academy Math Quizzes
- Anything that anyone else suggests to be added to this list

I will commit to the GitHub repo every day, and if I manage to finish off more than one line item, I will make a separate commit for each, also listing an approximation of how much time I spent on that and when in the day I did it. I will probably start with Khan Academy as it is definitely the low hanging fruit on this list.

Thank you to anyone who didn’t just read the TL;DR and I hope to get a ton of critical feedback from everyone here (especially any Grandmasters that might be lurking).
